This is a critical skill that demonstrates true understanding beyond simply lifting answers from the text. Work on inferential questions by reading between the lines and understanding the author's intent." },
            { title: 'Expand Your Active Vocabulary', description: "Don’t just learn new words; use them. Read widely beyond textbooks—news articles, stories, and opinion pieces. Keep a vocabulary journal to note down new words, their meanings, synonyms, and how to use them in a sentence. Aim to use a new word in your writing each day." },

Work through past N-Level papers to familiarize yourself with question patterns, common tricks, and the required presentation of answers. Analyze the marking scheme to understand how partial credits are awarded." },
            { title: 'Identify and Conquer Weak Topics', description: "Don't avoid topics you find difficult, such as trigonometry or geometry.

  {
    title: "Ignoring Mental and Physical Health",
    description: "The 'hustle culture' of sacrificing sleep and relaxation for endless cramming is extremely counterproductive. Burnout is a real threat that leads to mental fatigue, poor concentration, and lower exam performance. It's a marathon, not a sprint.",
    solution: "Schedule non-negotiable breaks into your study timetable. Ensure you get 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night, as this is when memory consolidation happens. Engage in physical activity and hobbies to de-stress. A healthy, rested mind performs exponentially better."
  },
  {
    title: "Poor Time Management During Exams",
    description: "It's heartbreaking to lose marks not because you don't know the answer, but because you ran out of time. Many students spend too long on questions they find difficult, leaving no time for easier questions at the end of the paper.",
    solution: "Practice full mock papers under strict, timed conditions. Develop a strategy for allocating time per section and per mark. If you're stuck on a question, mark it, move on, and come back later if you have time. Secure the easy marks first."
