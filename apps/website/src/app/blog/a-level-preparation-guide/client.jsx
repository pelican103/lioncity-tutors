For SBQs, practice identifying provenance, purpose, and tone to evaluate the reliability and utility of sources. Master the skills of comparison, cross-referencing, and detecting authorial bias to construct nuanced arguments." },
            { title: 'Engage with Historiography', description: "Top-tier history essays engage with different historical interpretations (historiography). For key events like the Cold War, understand the arguments of different schools of thought (e.g., Orthodox, Revisionist, Post-Revisionist). Incorporating these into your essays demonstrates a higher level of historical understanding." },
            { title: 'Craft a Strong, Thesis-Driven Argument', description: "An A-Level History essay must have a clear, consistent, and well-defended thesis statement that is established in the introduction and sustained throughout. Each paragraph should contribute directly to proving your overall argument, avoiding a narrative or descriptive approach." }
        ]
    },
    'H2 Literature in English': {
        icon: '📚',
        tips: [
            { title: 'Develop Sophisticated Close Reading Skills', description: "Literature is about analysing the 'how' as much as the 'what'. Practice detailed textual analysis (close reading), paying attention to literary devices, imagery, sentence structure (syntax), and tone. Your analysis must be grounded in specific evidence from the text." },
            { title: 'Engage with Literary Criticism and Theory', description: "Beyond your personal interpretation, showing awareness of different critical perspectives (e.g., feminist, post-colonial, psychoanalytic) can elevate your analysis. Understanding these lenses allows you to offer more nuanced and academically rigorous interpretations of your set texts." },
            { title: 'Master the Unseen Paper', description: "The unseen paper is a true test of your analytical abilities. Practice with a wide range of poems and prose passages.
