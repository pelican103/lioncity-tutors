            It’s a uniquely stressful feeling for a parent: you see your child's grades slipping, but the report card doesn't tell the whole story. You're left with a dozen unanswered questions. Is it the teacher? Is it a specific topic? Is it something more?
          </p>
          <p>
            Before you can find the right solution, you need the right diagnosis. This guide provides the same structured, 4-step diagnostic process our top tutors use to uncover the real root cause of academic struggles.

              <p>Gather your child’s recent worksheets and exam papers. Don't just look at the scores; look for patterns. The mistakes are clues.</p>

                <ul className="list-disc ml-4 space-y-2 text-sm">
                  <li><strong>Conceptual Gaps:</strong> Are mistakes clustered around topics like <strong>Fractions, Ratios, or Percentage</strong>? This points to a weak foundation.</li>
                  <li><strong>Application Gaps:</strong> Can they solve direct questions but fail at multi-step word problems? This reveals a weakness in <strong>Problem-Solving Heuristics</strong>.</li>
                  <li><strong>Careless Mistakes:</strong> Are marks lost to calculation errors or misreading instructions? This might be a focus issue, not a knowledge gap.</li>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-700 mb-3"><span className="text-green-300 font-bold mr-2">Step 2:</span> Conduct an 'Interview' - Ask "How," Not "Why"</h3>
              <p>Sit with your child and ask them to explain *how* they arrived at a wrong answer. "Why did you get this wrong?" can feel accusatory. "Show me how you did it," is an invitation to share their thought process.</p>
              <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-green-300 pl-4 italic text-gray-600 mt-4">
                  "A child's explanation is a window into their learning gaps. Phrases like 'I just guessed' or 'I forgot the formula' are goldmines of information for a tutor."

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-purple-700 mb-3"><span className="text-purple-300 font-bold mr-2">Step 3:</span> Stress-Test the Foundation</h3>
              <p>Learning is like building blocks. A shaky block at the bottom will cause everything above it to crumble. Give your child a question from a previous year's topic that underpins their current weak area.</p>
               <div className="bg-purple-50 p-4 rounded-lg mt-4 text-sm">
                <strong>Example:</strong> If your child is struggling with Secondary 3's <strong>Algebraic Manipulation</strong>, give them a Secondary 2 question on <strong>Expansion and Factorisation</strong>. If they struggle with that, you’ve likely found the real source of the problem.

              <p>Now that you have a clearer diagnosis, you can take targeted action. Your plan might be:</p>
               <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mt-4 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>For Conceptual Gaps:</strong> Dedicate revision time specifically to that foundational topic using assessment books.</li>
                <li><strong>For Application Gaps:</strong> Practice one type of word problem or heuristic per day to build confidence.</li>
                <li><strong>For Widespread or Deep Gaps:</strong> This is the point where seeking an expert who can create a structured recovery plan becomes the most effective strategy.</li>
