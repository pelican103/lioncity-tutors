          <p className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-800">
            "My child is bright, but they just can't focus." It’s a quiet frustration shared in parent group chats across Singapore. You see the potential, but it gets lost in a sea of distractions, half-finished homework, and careless mistakes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most common mistake is to see this as a character flaw ("laziness"). The most effective approach is to see focus for what it is: a skill. Like a muscle, it can be weak if untrained, but it can also be strengthened with the right exercises and the right environment.

            <p>Before you can train the muscle, you need the right "gym." Here are three expert-backed environmental changes you can make today.</p>
            <div className="grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-6 mt-6">
              {/* Card 1 */}
              <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg border shadow-sm hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow duration-300">
                <h4 className="font-semibold text-green-700">1. Create a "Focus Sanctuary"</h4>
                <p className="text-sm mt-2">Designate a single, clutter-free space for deep work. No phones, no TV, no siblings. <strong>Why it works:</strong> The brain creates associations. When this space is ONLY for work, sitting down there sends a powerful signal to the brain that it's time to concentrate.</p>
              </div>
              {/* Card 2 */}
              <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg border shadow-sm hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow duration-300">
                 <h4 className="font-semibold text-green-700">2. The Pomodoro Technique</h4>
                 <p className="text-sm mt-2">Use a timer. Work for 25 minutes, then take a mandatory 5-minute break. <strong>Why it works:</strong> It teaches the brain to work in focused sprints, making large tasks less intimidating and preventing mental fatigue. It proves that focus has a clear start and end point.</p>
              </div>
              {/* Card 3 */}
               <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg border shadow-sm hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow duration-300">
                 <h4 className="font-semibold text-green-700">3. Define the Finish Line</h4>
                 <p className="text-sm mt-2">Never say "study for an hour." Instead, say "complete these 10 questions." <strong>Why it works:</strong> A clear, achievable goal is motivating. An undefined block of time is daunting and encourages procrastination.</p>
