        <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p>
            You ask your child to write a story for their homework, and they stare at the blank page for what feels like an eternity. Or perhaps the stories they do write are short, lack detail, and always seem to start with "One day...". If this sounds familiar, you're not alone. Many parents in Singapore find it challenging to help their child with Primary School English composition.
          </p>
          <p>
            This guide is designed to help you identify the root causes of these struggles and provide simple, actionable tips you can use at home to help your child become a more confident and effective writer.
          </p>

          {/* The 5 Signs Section */}
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">The 5 Observable Signs</h2>

          <h3>Sign 1: The Blank Page Paralysis</h3>
          <p>
            This is the struggle to simply start writing. Your child may complain they have "no ideas," get distracted easily, or spend more time sharpening their pencil than writing. This often stems from a fear of making mistakes or a lack of structured brainstorming techniques.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Sign 2: Weak Story Structure</h3>
          <p>
            These are stories that are just a list of events connected by "And then... and then...". They lack a clear beginning, a rising tension, a climax, and a satisfying conclusion. This is a common issue for students who haven't been taught the fundamentals of narrative planning.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Sign 3: "Telling" Instead of "Showing"</h3>
          <p>
            This is the difference between writing "He was angry" (Telling) and "He clenched his fists, his face turned red, and his jaw tightened" (Showing). Children often default to telling because it's easier, but "showing" is what makes a story engaging and is a key skill for scoring well in PSLE English.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Sign 4: Repetitive Vocabulary</h3>
          <p>
            Does your child use the same simple words over and over? (e.g., "nice," "sad," "walk"). A limited vocabulary can make their stories feel flat and uninteresting. They may have great ideas but lack the words to express them vividly.
          </p>

          <h3>Sign 5: Persistent Grammatical Errors</h3>
          <p>
            Frequent mistakes in tense, subject-verb agreement, and punctuation can make a story difficult to read and understand. While some errors are normal, persistent issues may point to a weak foundational understanding of English grammar.
          </p>

          {/* Actionable Tips Section */}
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Actionable Tips for Parents</h2>

          <p>Here are practical ways you can help your child overcome each of these challenges:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>For Blank Page Paralysis:</strong> Use visual story prompts. Find an interesting picture online or in a magazine and ask your child the "5 Ws" (Who, What, Where, When, Why) about it to spark ideas.</li>
            <li><strong>For Weak Structure:</strong> Introduce the "Story Mountain." Draw a simple mountain shape and map out the key points: Beginning, Rising Action, Climax, Falling Action, and Resolution. This simple planning tool gives their story a clear path.</li>
            <li><strong>For "Telling vs. Showing":</strong> Play a game. Write a simple "telling" sentence (e.g., "The food was delicious.") and challenge your child to rewrite it by describing the taste, smell, and texture without using the word "delicious."</li>
            <li><strong>For Repetitive Vocabulary:</strong> Create a "Word Bank" in a notebook. Whenever you read a book together and find an interesting new word, add it to the bank. Encourage them to use one or two new words in their next composition.</li>
          </ul>

          {/* The Bridge to Your Service */}
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">When You Need Expert Guidance</h2>
          <p>
            While these home strategies build a great foundation, overcoming deep-seated writing challenges often requires personalized guidance. A specialist tutor can do more than just correct grammar; they can pinpoint your child's exact weaknesses and provide the focused practice and encouragement they need to transform their writing.
