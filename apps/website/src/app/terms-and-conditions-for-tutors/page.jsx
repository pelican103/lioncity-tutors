                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Registration</h2>

                </p>

                <p className="mb-8">
                    All tutors are required to provide accurate information on academic certifications and personal particulars. Clients reserve the right to request for these certifications to be presented for verification at any point in time. Tutors who attempt to deceive clients with fake qualifications and certifications will be reported to the Police.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">General Terms for Lesson Conduct</h2>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                    <li>Keep to the agreed rates and timeslots. Any changes must be mutually agreed with the client. If a change of timing is required, provide at least 48 hours’ notice. In cases of sudden illness, an MC may be requested by the client.</li>
                    <li>Be aware of and agreeable to the full address/location of lessons, and plan transport accordingly before accepting an assignment.</li>
                    <li>Conduct lessons personally; do not send a representative or substitute.</li>
                    <li>Practice punctuality and do not short-change lesson timing.</li>
                    <li>No physical or verbal abuse towards students or parents will be tolerated.</li>

                </ul>
                <p className="mb-8">
                    Any breach of these terms without a valid reason may result in a permanent mark on our records, and if necessary, a complete blacklist from all LionCity Tutors platforms.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Commitment of Tutoring Period</h2>
                <p className="mb-8">
                    Unless otherwise stated, tutors are expected to commit to the assignment for a long-term basis (generally at least 3 months). If you are unable to fulfill the commitment due to special reasons or circumstances, you are required to inform LionCity Tutors to avoid misunderstanding and prevent blacklisting for future assignments.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-8">
                    After the first conducted lesson, tutors are expected to make arrangements directly with the client for subsequent lessons. Any personal, payment, or cancellation terms should be clearly communicated to the client after the first lesson.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Commission and Payment of Tutor Fees</h2>
                <p className="mb-8">
                    A confirmation note & invoice will be sent upon the successful confirmation of each tuition assignment. Upon completion of the first 2 weeks of lessons, clients are required to make payment for the first 2 weeks’ fees to LionCity Tutors. Future payments may be made directly to the tutor. If the client is unwilling or unable to transfer LionCity Tutors the commission, the tutor may be required to collect it on our behalf and transfer it to LionCity Tutors as soon as possible.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Commission Amount</h2>
                <p className="mb-8">
                    LionCity Tutors collects a one-time commission equivalent to the first 2 weeks of lessons from its tutors. The commission will be collected directly from the client and there will be no further action on the tutor’s part. If there are any additional tuition services added during the first month (e.g., tuition for siblings or additional subjects), this must be made known to LionCity Tutors and will also be due for commission.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Short-Term Assignments</h2>
                <p className="mb-8">
                    Assignments spanning 11 weeks or less are considered Short-Term Assignments. The general commission taken will be 25% of the total lesson fees, subject to a cap based on the total lessons conducted:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Tier 1:</strong> 16 lessons or less → capped at 2 lessons commission</li>
                    <li><strong>Tier 2:</strong> 17 to 24 lessons → capped at 3 lessons commission</li>
                    <li><strong>Tier 3:</strong> 25 lessons or more → capped at 4 lessons commission</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mb-8">
                    LionCity Tutors will state in the assignment details whether the assignment is deemed a Short-Term Assignment. Any assignment not stated as such is considered a Long-Term Assignment by default.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-8">
                    If a Short-Term Assignment is discontinued, LionCity Tutors will collect 25% of the total lesson fees (subject to the above caps) and the tutor will receive 75%. If a tutor cancels the assignment without a valid reason, they may not be entitled to any tuition fees for lessons conducted, and LionCity Tutors reserves the right to bill the tutor for 25% of the intended total lesson fees.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Tutor Cancellation</h2>
                <p className="mb-8">
                    The client has the right to request a change in tutor at any time. If tuition is cancelled or changed within the first 4 weeks by the client, LionCity Tutors will collect 50% of the tuition rates involved; the remaining 50% will be paid directly to the tutor.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-8">
                    Tutors may not be entitled to their share of 50% of the fees in cases such as:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4">
                    <li>Cancellation of assignment by the tutor</li>
                    <li>Failure to conduct lessons to a reasonable standard</li>
                    <li>False or inaccurate information in the tutoring profile</li>
                    <li>Inability to provide supporting documents for information listed in the profile</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mb-8">
                    LionCity Tutors will assess each case individually and reserves the right to make the final decision.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Tuition Rates</h2>
                <p className="mb-8">
                    The agreed tuition rates should not be changed after lesson confirmation. However, tutors may increase the rate if the student advances to a higher academic level.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Length of Commitment, Postponement of Lessons, and Last Minute Cancellations</h2>
                <p className="mb-8">
                    Once confirmation has been received, the tutor is expected to complete at least 4 weeks of lessons. Irresponsible behaviour may result in blacklisting. If postponement is necessary, inform the client at least 2 days in advance. In cases of sudden illness, an MC may be required.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-8">
                    For last-minute cancellations of the first arranged lesson, if a client cancels less than 2 hours before the scheduled time, they will be liable to pay 50% of the lesson fees as compensation for the tutor’s transport cost and time.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-8">
                    For cancellations of subsequent lessons, tutors should communicate their personal cancellation policies to the client directly.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Location of Lessons</h2>
                <p className="mb-8">
                    Tuition lessons will be conducted at the designated address listed in the assignment.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Collusion & Fraud</h2>
                <p className="mb-8">
                    Any attempts to avoid the commission payable to LionCity Tutors are considered illegal. We do not tolerate such fraudulent and unethical actions. A police report will be made immediately, and civil actions will be commenced to recover lost monies.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Disclaimer</h2>
