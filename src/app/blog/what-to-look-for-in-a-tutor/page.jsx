      <article className="space-y-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        <p className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-800">
          With over 70% of Singapore students attending private tuition, choosing the right tutor can make the difference between academic struggle and success. Here's your comprehensive guide to finding the perfect educational partner for your child.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">1. Academic Qualifications and Subject Expertise</h2>
          <p>
            While a degree doesn't guarantee great teaching, it's essential for credibility. Look for tutors with:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mt-3">
            <li><strong>Relevant academic background:</strong> Mathematics tutors should have strong quantitative education, while English tutors benefit from language or literature backgrounds</li>
            <li><strong>Understanding of Singapore's education system:</strong> Familiarity with MOE syllabus, examination formats, and recent curriculum changes</li>
            <li><strong>Specialized knowledge:</strong> For challenging subjects like H2 Chemistry or A-Level Economics, look for tutors with advanced qualifications in these specific areas</li>
          </ul>
          <div className="bg-amber-50 p-4 rounded-lg mt-3 border-l-4 border-amber-200">
            <p><strong>Red flag:</strong> Tutors who claim to teach "everything" from Primary 1 to A-Levels across all subjects often lack deep expertise in any single area.</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">2. Teaching Experience and Track Record</h2>
          <p>
            Experience matters, but the right type of experience matters more. Prioritize tutors who have:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mt-3">
            <li><strong>Consistent improvement records:</strong> Ask for specific examples of student grade improvements, not just general claims</li>
            <li><strong>Experience with your child's academic level:</strong> A tutor excellent with Primary students may struggle with A-Level concepts</li>
            <li><strong>Recent teaching experience:</strong> Education evolves; look for tutors actively engaged with current syllabi</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-3 bg-green-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <strong>Ask the right questions:</strong> "Can you share examples of students who improved from B to A grades?" or "How do you adapt lessons for students struggling with specific topics?"
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">3. Communication Style and Personality Fit</h2>
          <p>
            Academic excellence means nothing if your child doesn't connect with the tutor. Consider:
          </p>
          <div className="space-y-4 mt-3">
            <div>
              <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-800">Patience and Encouragement</h4>
              <p>Singapore's competitive environment can be stressful. Your tutor should build confidence, not add pressure.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-800">Clear Communication</h4>
              <p>Can they explain complex concepts in simple terms? Do they check for understanding regularly?</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-800">Adaptability</h4>
              <p>Every child learns differently. Great tutors adjust their teaching style to match your child's learning preferences.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">4. Structured Approach and Progress Tracking</h2>
          <p>
            Professional tutors don't just "help with homework." They should provide:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mt-3">
            <li><strong>Customized lesson plans:</strong> Based on initial assessment of your child's strengths and weaknesses</li>
            <li><strong>Regular progress updates:</strong> Monthly reports showing improvement areas and ongoing challenges</li>
            <li><strong>Goal-oriented approach:</strong> Clear targets for each term, whether it's improving specific topic understanding or overall grade improvement</li>
            <li><strong>Resource provision:</strong> Access to quality practice materials, past-year papers, and additional learning resources</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">5. Practical Considerations</h2>
          <div className="space-y-4">
            <div>
              <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-800">Scheduling Flexibility</h4>
              <p>Life happens. Look for tutors who can accommodate occasional rescheduling and offer makeup sessions for genuine emergencies.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-800">Location and Convenience</h4>
              <p>Factor in travel time and costs. Sometimes a slightly less qualified tutor who's nearby can be more effective than an excellent one who's difficult to reach.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-800">Professional Boundaries</h4>
              <p>Professional tutors maintain appropriate boundaries, arrive punctually, and communicate respectfully with both parents and students.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">Questions to Ask Potential Tutors</h2>
          <div className="bg-blue-50 p-5 rounded-lg">
            <ul className="space-y-2">
              <li>• "How do you typically help students who are struggling with [specific topic]?"</li>
              <li>• "What's your approach to preparing students for major examinations?"</li>
              <li>• "How do you communicate progress to parents?"</li>
              <li>• "Can you provide references from recent students or parents?"</li>
              <li>• "What resources do you use beyond textbooks?"</li>
              <li>• "How do you handle students who lack motivation?"</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">The Trial Period Advantage</h2>
          <p>
            Many excellent tutors offer trial sessions or short-term arrangements before committing to longer contracts. Use this time to evaluate:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1 mt-3">
            <li>Your child's comfort level and engagement</li>
            <li>The tutor's teaching methodology in practice</li>
            <li>Communication effectiveness</li>
            <li>Whether promised improvements begin to materialize</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-3 font-medium">
            Remember: the most expensive tutor isn't always the best, and the cheapest option often comes with hidden costs in terms of your child's academic progress.
