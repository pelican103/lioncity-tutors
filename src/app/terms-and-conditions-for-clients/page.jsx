                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Acceptance of Terms and Conditions</h2>
                <p className="mb-8">
                    By engaging a tutor from LionCity Tutors, you accept the Terms and Conditions listed below regarding the tuition service provided. The engagement is formalized when a Confirmation Note has been sent to you via WhatsApp/SMS/Email, or/and when the tutor has conducted the first tuition lesson as arranged in the respective correspondence with the client.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Payment and Commission</h2>
                <p>
                    LionCity Tutors’ matching services are free-of-charge for the client as commission fees are levied upon the tutor. Upon completion of 2 weeks of lessons (or as otherwise stated in the Confirmation Note) with the tutor, the client is to make payment for 2 weeks of lesson fees (or otherwise advised amount) to LionCity Tutors. Payment may be made via Bank Transfer, PayNow, PayLah, or Cheque. This payment represents the commission collected from LionCity Tutors, which is levied upon the tutor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Subsequent payments may be made directly to the tutors in a payment method and frequency decided between the client and tutor. Any additional tuition services, such as an additional subject or teaching of the student’s siblings, must be disclosed to LionCity Tutors and will also be liable for commission, which will similarly be charged to the tutor.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-8">
                    In the case of an extreme short-term assignment (4 or fewer lessons), a client may agree to bear the commission on behalf of the tutor to increase the chances of securing a suitable tutor. This arrangement is non-exchangeable with the usual case (where the tutor bears the commission). Even if the client decides to take more than the agreed number of lessons, the commission will not be transferred to the tutor.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Tutor Reassignment or Cancellation</h2>
                <p>
                    If the client is unsatisfied or uncomfortable with the tutor arranged within the first 4 weeks, the client may request a change in tutor at any time after the first conducted lesson. The client is only required to pay for all lessons conducted so far, and no further fees. The general guideline is a commitment period of 1 month before deciding whether the tuition services are suitable for the student.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For cancellations by the client before 4 full weeks of lessons are completed, LionCity Tutors will split 50% of the total lesson fees with the tutor. The client is required to pay LionCity Tutors the amount reflected in the invoice issued, which is 50% of the total lesson fees conducted. Regarding the tutor’s fees, clients may pay the tutor directly or request LionCity Tutors to transfer the fees on their behalf. Cancellations due to last-minute emergencies will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-8">
                    In the rare case of a cancellation of the tuition assignment by the tutor, the lessons carried out by the tutor will generally still have to be paid for. LionCity Tutors will consider these reasons on a case-by-case basis to determine if full payment by the client for the lessons conducted is required. By accepting these Terms & Conditions, you agree to respect and adhere to the final decisions made by LionCity Tutors on these matters.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Last Minute Cancellations & Postponement of First Lesson</h2>
                <p className="mb-8">
                    If a postponement or cancellation of the first lesson is required, the client must inform LionCity Tutors or the tutor at least 4 hours in advance. If this condition is not met, clients are liable to pay for 50% of the 1st lesson fees as compensation for the tutor’s time and transport costs, and the service rendered by LionCity Tutors. This amount will be split 50% between LionCity Tutors and the tutor. Cancellations due to last-minute emergencies will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Late Payment Charges</h2>
                <p>
                    LionCity Tutors reserves the right to impose a late-payment fee for overdue fees of 1 month or more. The late-payment fee after 1 month will be $50 per 2 weeks (14 days) of overdue payment after the 1st month of grace period. Other administrative fees may also be charged depending on the resources/time taken to recover the debt, judged on a case-by-case basis.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-8">
                    <strong>Example:</strong> If a client fails to make payment after the grace period, late-payment charges will be imposed for every 2 weeks of non-payment until the final order of the court is given. LionCity Tutors also reserves the right to file with the Small Claims Tribunal or take legal action for any debt deemed necessary.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Qualifications & Authentication of Tutor Profiles/Documents</h2>
                <p>
                    Clients may request the educational certifications of tutors to authenticate their qualifications and credibility. LionCity Tutors will request these documents on the client’s behalf and forward them if the tutor agrees to share them.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-8">
                    LionCity Tutors is not liable for falsehoods or untruths provided by tutors in their applications. While we have internal vetting systems, it is not possible to verify every piece of information. If a client discovers a fraudulent tutor, please inform LionCity Tutors and we will assist in making a police report.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Tuition Rates and Schedule</h2>
                <p className="mb-8">
                    The schedule of tuition is open to rearrangement with the tutor directly after the first lesson. Future tuition rates may also be renegotiated when the student advances to a higher academic level.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Location of Tuition</h2>
                <p className="mb-8">
                    Tuition will be carried out at the location provided by the client unless otherwise arranged or specified.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Collusion & Fraud</h2>
                <p className="mb-8">
                    Any attempts to avoid the commission payable to LionCity Tutors are considered illegal. We do not tolerate such fraudulent and unethical actions. A police report will be made immediately, and civil actions will be commenced to recover lost monies.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Quality of Service</h2>
                <p className="mb-8">
                    LionCity Tutors does not guarantee that tutoring services will result in improved academic grades. We strive to provide the best and most suitable tutor possible within the client’s requests and budget. Once lessons have been carried out, clients are liable to pay tuition fees for lessons attended, regardless of satisfaction. Tutoring services may be cancelled at any time if deemed unsatisfactory by the client. Feedback is appreciated.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Disclaimer</h2>
                <p className="mb-8">
                    LionCity Tutors will make every effort to create the most suitable match between clients and tutors.
